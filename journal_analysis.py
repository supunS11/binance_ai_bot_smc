"""Joins signal_journal.csv's signal rows to their outcome rows by
trade_id and breaks down win/breakeven/loss rates by the diagnostic
fields captured at signal time - the actual mechanism for answering "why
did these SL hit" with evidence instead of a guess.

Run directly on the machine with the real journal:
    python journal_analysis.py [hours_back]

`hours_back` restricts this to trades that CLOSED within that window -
use it to look only at trades resolved after a deploy/fix, since a fixed
number of stale pre-fix rows doesn't get diluted out just because more
trades pile up elsewhere. Omit it to include the whole journal.

Only trades logged after the trade_id correlation fix (this file's
counterpart change in signal_journal.py/position_manager.py) can be
joined - older rows without a trade_id are silently skipped, not guessed
at via symbol/time proximity.
