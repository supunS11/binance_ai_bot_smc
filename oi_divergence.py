"""Open-interest divergence: price's swing structure compared against
OI's value at those same points in time - a new price extreme that isn't
backed by expanding OI (fresh positioning) is weaker evidence than one
where OI genuinely built up alongside it. Same divergence concept as
cvd_divergence.py, applied to a different metric with a different
alignment strategy: OI is a periodically-POLLED series
(config.OI_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS), not one sample per candle close, so
matching a swing to an OI reading uses the nearest sample AT OR BEFORE
that time instead of an exact-timestamp dict lookup.

Real unit mismatch to get right: a candle's open_time (Binance kline "t")
is milliseconds since epoch; open_interest.OpenInterestEngine records its
own samples against time.time() - SECONDS since epoch. Every open_time
here is converted to seconds (/1000) before comparing against oi_history
timestamps - comparing them raw would silently misalign every lookup
(a millisecond timestamp is ~1000x any real second-based one, so the
"at or before" search would effectively always return the newest sample
regardless of which swing it was supposedly matched to).

    Both directions use the SAME underlying condition - OI declining
    across the compared swing pair - unlike cvd_divergence.py's
    direction-specific comparison: a falling OI means positions are being
    closed regardless of which way price just moved, so it can't be
    backing either a fresh breakout up OR down.

    Bearish divergence: the most recent swing HIGH is higher than the one
    before it (price still making new highs), but OI fell by at least
    min_delta_pct over that same span - the rally isn't backed by fresh
    long positioning (likely short-covering only) -> SELL.

    Bullish divergence: the mirror, on swing LOWs -> BUY (the decline
    isn't backed by fresh short positioning).
