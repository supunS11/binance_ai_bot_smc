"""Combines HTF bias, LTF structure (CHoCH/BOS into an order block or FVG,
inside the OTE zone), liquidity-sweep confluence, and real-time order-flow
confirmation (CVD + depth imbalance) into a single entry signal.

This replaces v7/v8's strategy.py trend/confirm/entry cascade. The
difference isn't the concepts (structure + confirmation is the same
shape) - it's that every input here is live/event-driven off the websocket
feed, evaluated against the current forming candle, instead of only ever
looking at what already closed.

`evaluate()` always returns a dict with at least `signal` (None or
"BUY"/"SELL") and `reason` - callers that want to see *why* a candidate
was rejected (for the shadow journal) get that for free.
