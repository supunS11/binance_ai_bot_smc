"""Places the entry, then attaches SL + TP1 + TP2 using the same order
mechanics v7/v8 use: a full-position STOP_MARKET (closePosition=true) for
the stop, a reduce-only TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET for TP1's partial quantity, and
a full-position TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET (closePosition=true) for TP2 covering
whatever remains after TP1.

Defaults to SHADOW mode (config.EXECUTION_MODE) - real order placement
only happens once that's explicitly switched to LIVE, so the very first
run of this bot cannot place a real order by accident.
