"""Turns a signal_engine candidate into concrete SL / TP1 / TP2 prices and
a position size.

The stop comes first - beyond the structure level that triggered the
entry, plus a small ATR buffer - and everything else derives from it:
position size is solved from the risk distance (the "1% rule", via
risk_management.calculate_position_size).

TP1/TP2 target real liquidity pools when one exists with enough room,
matching v7's find_structure_take_profit (price is drawn toward real
liquidity, not an arbitrary multiple of the stop - that's the actual
premise of SMC). The R-multiple (2R/4R) is a floor, not the primary
target: it sets the *minimum* acceptable distance a structure target must
clear, and is used directly as a fallback only when no real level exists
out that far - same shape as v7's ENTRY_MIN_TP_ROOM_ROI/STRUCTURE_TP_MIN_ROI
fallback.
